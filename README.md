# item_app overview
This time I made a game of Sudoku, With mutiple options for the player to choose from. Such as picking an easy or hard board, allowing them to save their game, and show possible solutions to the sudoku board. I hope that as I continue to practice using several languages that ill get a better grasp on devloping code and have experiance in several languages, which will help in my overall goal to become a excellent software engineer. This projects has the following charecteristics:
The game asks the user to pick a board_file and then displays aa list of options such as edit board, display board, show possible values, save board, and quit. The game takes user input which for this game takes input from the keybored. 
I also added a stretch challenges which is accesing a file, which in this programs case is the word file that the program uses as the board and can also save to update the board.
I wrote this for the purpose of streatching myself and gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation to writing programs.
