# item_app overview
This time a made an app using Android studio, which is another first for me and as for any software engineer it is good to be well versed in many different languages and
a good habit to open your mind to tring something new. So the app is rather simple, its a random number generator. As you open up the app it shows the main page explaining what it is, I made it for the purpose to persuade those who make purchases online to decide how many items they want to buy. When the user clicks the button it will lead them to another page which has an option to select how many numbers you want to go between randomly, up to 10. Then when they click the roll button it will display a random number beteen one and the number they selected. So whenver deciding how much you should splurge for online purchases you can leave it up to fate in how much you should buy.
